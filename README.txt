This code reads SEGD2.1 files output by Sercel software. It is based on code written by Kevin Hall, available at https://github.com/GeoKylin/Segd2Segy.

The SEGD files can either be read using the jupyter notebook script (segd2_conversion.ipynb) or the MATLAB script (data_conversion.m). Both make use of the sercel_SEGD2_reader.m function.

Make sure the jupyter notebook is opened within the same folder as the sercel_SEGD2_reader.m script.
