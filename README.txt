This code reads SEGD2.1 files output by Sercel software. It is based on code written by Kevin Hall, available at https://github.com/GeoKylin/Segd2Segy.

The SEGD files can either be read using the Jupyter-Notebook script (segd2_conversion.ipynd) or the MATLAB script (data_conversion.m). Both make use of the sercel_SEGD2_TMC_Jan25.m function.
